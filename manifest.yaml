  long_description: "Greetings, I'm TavernBot :robot_face:\r

    \r

    I keep a directory of pubs/bars/venues that your team likes, and can suggest where to go for your next get together.\r

    \r

    You can summon me simply by typing my name - 'TavernBot' - either in a direct message to me, or in one of the channels I'm deployed in, usually 'general' or 'random'.\r

    \r

    I was created by Stuart Palmer, using Slack Bolt JS and hosted on AWS Lambda. My code is located here: https://github.com/stuart-p/Slack-TavernBot\r

    \r

    v1.00 - Initial release; add pubs to the directory, and request the name of a pub from the list"
